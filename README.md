### **Technologies Used**

React

Bootstrap with react

Axios for API

Firebase

### **User Stories**

User is able to:

- View shopping items
- Place items in cart
- Checkout
- Go to the individual footer links
- Sign In/Out


### **Planning**

Began with home page, where all the links will lead to. 

Broke it down to the individual components & how the states/props will tie to each other

Figure out which functions are needed (D.R.Y)

### **Problem-solving**

Lots of documentation combing & constantly breaking apart my app

### **Unsolved problems**

List:

- Language still not changeable 
- No loading animation for pages
- Sign In/Out not linked to page functionality

### **API used**

Pixabay - shopping images

GoogleMaps - store locator map

Firebase - storage of rider info and shopping items' details
